MY CURRENT READ: - "A Humans Guide to Machine Intelligence by Kartik Hosanagar.

#### What I think

IMHO This book should be a definite read for any student prior to joining a Data Science course.  Kartik has tried to make it as simple as listening to a novel storyline. I really enjoyed listening to the audiobook borrowed from the local library, the pace and innotation of the narrator Zoe Knezevich was really awesome and impactful.
